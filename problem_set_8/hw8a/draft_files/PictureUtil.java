//In this exercise we are going to manipulate images with the Picture class. We are
//studying 2D arrays so we will work with the 2D int array that is returned by
//Picture's getGraylevels method. This method is dicussed at the end of lesson 7.3.
//Each element of the array coresponds to a pixel in the image. The color has been
//transformed from an RGB color to a gray scale value.

//The Picture class also has a constructor that takes a 2D int array as a parameter.
//You will use that, too.

//Your task is to complete the two methods in the PictureUtil. Notice these are static methods.
//They do not act on instance variables of the PictureUtil class. In fact, the class has no
//instance data.

//Here is a description of the methods

//private static Picture grayAndFlipLeftToRight( Picture pic) :
//- This method converts the image into a 2D array of gray scale values and then flips it
//left to right. That is, an object that was facing left will now be facing right.
//The elements on the left most column will be swapped with those in the right-most column
//and so on. Manipulate the elements in the array so that the first column is swapped with
//the last column and the second column is swapped with the next to the last and so on.
//Do not make a second array.
//Then call the Picture constructor that takes a 2D int array and return the picture.

//private static Picture grayAndRotate90( Picture pic):
//- This method converts the image into a 2D array of gray scale values and then rotates it
//90 degrees clockwise (lays it on its right side). To do this, create a new array where
//the number of columns in the original array becomes the number of rows in the new array
//and the number of rows in the original becomes the number of colums. Then copy the elements
//from the first array into the proper place in the second array so that the image is
//rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The first row will become the last column
//[0][0] -> [0][numberOfColums - 1]

//There is a starter project for this problem that contains the graphics classes you will
//need, the tester, and the image used by the tester

//For the draft: In PictureUtil, implement GrayAndFlipLeftToRight to return a version of the
//original picture in gray scale
