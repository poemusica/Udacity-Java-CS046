// BlueJ project: lesson2/crate

// Draw a crate by combining a rectangle with five lines.
//
// The front face is a rectangle with top left corner (20, 30), 
// width 100, and height 40. 
//
// A diagonal line goes from the face's top left corner  to (50, 10). 
// Another diagonal line goes from the face's bottom right corner 
// to (150, 50).
// A third diagonal starts at the face's top right corner and is
// parallel to the others.
// The fourth and fifth line join the end points of the diagonals.
//
// Before programming, get out a pen and draw the crate on a
// sheet of paper! Label each of the points with their coordinates.
//
// Also, don't forget to call draw() on your rectangle and line objects.
