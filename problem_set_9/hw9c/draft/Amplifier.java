// In this problem you will create a class heirarchy of electronic circuits. You do not have
// to understand anything about circuits to do this problem. Just look at the specification
// for the Java classes (That is what I did)
//
// Here is a link to a diagram showing the kinds of operational amplifiers we will be
// working with
//
// The input to the amplifier is the voltage Vi and the output is the voltage Vo. The output
// of an amplifier is proportional to the input. The constant of proportionality is called
// the gain of the amplifier.

// You have been supplied with a class that models this Amplifier(a). It is the super class.
// You will write  the three subclasses: InvertingAmplifier(b), NoninvertingAmplifier(c), and
// VoltageDividerAmplifier(d).
//
// R1 and R2 represent resistance. The gain (g) is calculated from the resistance as follows:
// InvertingAmplifier:         g = R2 / R1
// NoninvertingAmplifier:      g = 1 + (R2 / R1)
// VoltageDividerAmplifier:    g = R2 / (R1 + R2)
//
// Each subclass will override the getGain method to return the appropriate gain
//
// For the draft, write the InvertingAmplifier which will extend Amplifier.
//
//You do not need to change thiclass
