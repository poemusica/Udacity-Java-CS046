//Create a Polygon class. A polygon is a closed shape with lines joining the corner points.
//You will keep the points in an array list. Use object of java.awt.Point for the point.

//Polygon will have as an instance variable an ArrayList of Points to hold the points
//The constructor takes no parameters but initializes the instance variable
//
//The add method adds a Point to the polygon
//
//The perimeter method returns the perimeter of the polygon
//
//The draw method draws the polygon by connecting consecutive points and then
//connecting the last point to the first.
//
//No methods headers or javadoc is provided this time. You get to try your hand at writing a class almost from scratch
//
//For the draft, finish the constructor.
//Have the perimeter method return 0 and have the draw mwthod draw a
//line from point 0, 0 to point 30, 40
//
