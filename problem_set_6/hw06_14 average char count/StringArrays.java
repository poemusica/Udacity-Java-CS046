// Complete the method in this class to find the average length of the words in an
// array list of strings and return it. The average length of words is sometimes used
// as a simple measure of reading difficulty.
//
// Note that you want to keep the fractional part of the average
//
// Hint: If yo udo not know where to start, look at the ArrayLit Algorithms to find an appropriate one.
