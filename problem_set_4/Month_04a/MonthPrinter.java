//Write a class Month.

//A Month has a constructor that takes the month number as a parameter (1 for January, 2 for February and so forth)
//   public Month(int monthNumber)
//If monthNumber is not 1 to 12, set it to 1

//And 2 methods
//   public String getMonthName() Use if / else if /else if ...
//   public int getNumberOfDays() Do NOT use a separate if / else branch for each month. Use Boolean operators (&&, ||, !).
//       You will have an if then else if then else.
//       For February return 28

//Now write a class MonthPrinter which will instantiate a Month object, ask the user for a month number
//and print the name of the month and the number or days.

//If the month is 6, the output should look exactly like this
//June 30

//If the user enters an invalid month number print this error message: "Number must be 1 through 12"

//If the user enters a non-integer, give this error message: "Enter an integer"

//To be considered correct, you must enter the message exactly as specified.

//For the draft:
//In Month, provide the constructor and the instance variable.

//In MonthTester, ask the usr for a number 1 to 12 and create a date object with that number
