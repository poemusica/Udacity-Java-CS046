/**
 * Complete the class. Using a Scanner, ask the user to enter a series of integers
 * and count the number of even numbers
 * Use a loop. Do not let bad input (a non-integer) terminate your program with an error.
 * When the user enters any non-integer, print the number of even integers entered and quit.
 * Hint: remember hasNextInt()
 * Hint: use the % operator to determine if a number is even
