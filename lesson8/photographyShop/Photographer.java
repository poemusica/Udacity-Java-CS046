// TO-DO
// What methods do you want a photographer object to be
// able to carry out?
// This class currently has some logic for finding file names for
// photos given a description. You should use the takePicture method.
// You don't need to understand how readPhotos works.
// You do need to know that the two lines in the constructor must stay in
// the constructor or the takePicture method won't work.
